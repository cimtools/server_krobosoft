# New services:
New services must be added to the router, better not to temper with the server without reason.

The new services as classes with 2 static functions, one to match the request path to the service (allowing restfull services),
and the other the call to the service.


# Generating a server version:
Basic c++ lib download and build: https://github.com/GiulianoWF/SampleCppProject


cd Buid
conan install ..
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cp ../bin/main ../../FreezedVersion/

// !!The vscode extension may change de generated binary directory!!
