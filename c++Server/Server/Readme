# New services:
===============

New services must be added to the router, better not to temper with the server without reason.

The new services as classes with 2 static functions, one to match the request path to the service (allowing restfull services),
and the other the call to the service.


# Generating a server version:
==============================

Extra instructions to using conan: 
  https://conan.io/
  https://github.com/GiulianoWF/SampleCppProject

in the folder /c++Server/Server/

cd Buid
conan install ..
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cp ../bin/main ../../FreezedVersion/

!!The vscode cmake extension may change the generated binary directory!!
